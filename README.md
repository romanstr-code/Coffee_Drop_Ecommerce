<!-- Description of Project -->
<p style="color: #4D8076"><strong>Coffee Drop Ecommerce</strong>
<br>
Had an idea about creating a ecommerce store for like a year already. This idea of mine came to me during the quarantine time and of course when started studying programing with Code Institute. Everything should be easy to find, very natural to navigate and for sure need to be immediately appealing to the store travelers and users. Store should be ready to accomodate all kind of users. As well store needed to have a blog section and a subscribe letters for website enthusiasts. The colors should be kept mostly white and welcoming. I am very thrilled to present you <em style="color: #DEB887">Coffee Drop Ecommerce</em>

<li>Open Git and select clone from the repository tab. Enter source location " repo you want to clone " and the location you wish to store the files and press the clone button.</li>
<li>Clone the project using <em>git clone</em></li>
<li>Open your IDE. Travel to the directory where you stored the cloned files.</li>
<li>Install requirements from requirements.txt file by entering <em>pip3 install -r requirements.txt </em> in the terminal.</li>
<li>Activate your virtual environment by <em> py -m venv virtual</em> into the terminal.</li>
<li>Create an environment file <em>env.py</em> to store environment variables. Add environment variables as shown:</li>
<li>Run a PostgresSQL database. You can use if you want:</li>
<li>

[Dockerfile](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) 

</li>
<li><em>os.environ.setdefault('SECRET_KEY', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_SECRET_KEY', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('STRIPE_WH_SECRET', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_USER', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_PASS', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('EMAIL_HOST_USER', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY', '')</em</li>
<li>os.environ.setdefault('DATABASE_URL', '')</em</li>
<li>env.py</em> to a <li><em>.gitignore</em> file so sensitive data will not be pushed to GIT</li>
<li>Run <em>python3 manage.py migrate</em</li>
<li>You should now be able to run the program by entering <li><em>python3 app.py<em> into the terminal</li>
</ol>


> ###  *Deployment to Heroku* <hr>

<ol>
<li>Go to Heroku.</li>
<li>Login or Sign up.</li>
<li>Once logged, create a new app.</li>
<li>Give the app a name that will make sense to you.</li>
<li>Select your closest region to you.</li>
<li>Click create app.</li>
<li>On resource tab, in add-ons bar add Heroku Postgres Database.</li>
<li>To use Postgres you need to go back to gitpod.</li>
<li>Install <em>dj-database-url</em> and <em>psycopg2-binary</em>.</li>
<li>Once installed freeze requirements with <em>pip3 freeze > requirements.txt</em></li>
<li>Set up database by going to <em>settings.py<e/>m> and import <em>dj-database-url</em>.</li>
<li>In <em>settings.py</em> navigate to database settings and replace default database with a call to <em>dj_database_url.parse()</em>
</li>
<li>Add database URL from Heroku settings config vars inside parenthesis.</li>
<li>Run migrations in gitpod <em>python3 manage.py migrate</em> to apply migrations and apply database.</li>
<li>Import product data by entering <em>python3 manage.py loaddata categories</em> and <em>python3 manage.py loaddata products</em> Important!!! To be in this order</li>
<li>Add superuser to log in with <em>python3 manage.py createsuperuser</em></li>
<li><strong>Don't commit</strong> with Heroku database settings visible, change database back to original database URL before commit
</li>
<li>Install gunicorn and freeze requirements.</li>
<li>Now we can create our Procfile that tells Heroku to create a web dyno.</li>
<li>Temporarilly disable collect static by entering heroku <em>config:set DISAABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1  your name of the app </em></li>
<li>Add Host name of heroku app to allowed settings.py, allow local host as well to allow access from gitpod.</li>
<li>To push to heroku you may need to initialise your heroku git remote <em> heroku git:remote your name of the app </em></li>
<li>Then push to heroku <em>git push heroku master</em</li>
<li>We can set up to automatically push to heroku when we push to github by going to the heroku app.</li>
<li>Go to deploy tab. In deployment select Github.</li>
<li>Search for your repository and press connect.</li>
<li>Scroll down to automatic deploys and enable them.</li>
<li>Get secret key and add to heroku config settings.</li>
<li>Go to settings.py remove secret key and replace with a call to get it from the environment *SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')</li>
<li>Set debug to be True only if there is a variable called development in the environment DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
</li>
</ol>

### [CodeInstitute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

- Great school and great tutor, mentor, classmetes and customer support from you guys. Though I would say that the speed of studying for me as a full timer was extremely diffucult and on some point was thinking that was not gonna make it.
Now looking back I can surely say that I enjoyed the study process with you and now I know I need to study even more.
Hope will get my dream job and start working in Developement.
