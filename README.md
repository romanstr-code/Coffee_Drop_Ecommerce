<!-- Description of Project -->
<p style="color: #4D8076"><strong>Coffee Drop Ecommerce</strong>
<br>
Had an idea about creating a ecommerce store for like a year already. This idea of mine came to me during the quarantine time and of course when started studying programing with Code Institute. Everything should be easy to find, very natural to navigate and for sure need to be immediately appealing to the store travelers and users. Store should be ready to accomodate all kind of users. As well store needed to have a blog section and a subscribe letters for website enthusiasts. The colors should be kept mostly white and welcoming. I am very thrilled to present you <em style="color: #DEB887">Coffee Drop Ecommerce</em>
